<html>
    <head>
        <title>html js practise</title>  
        <script src="script.js"></script>

    </head>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <body>
        <h1 id="test">Hello Word!</h1>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
        <p>
            Given the above html, find out what happens when you try to access the element h1 
            in javascript (using document.getElementById) and change its content to 
            “Goodbye World” when the script is attached: 
            <h3>● In the head tag</h3> 
             <p>
                -At this point, the browser processes the "head" section before rendering the "body". 
                Since the "h1" element with id="test" is in the "body", it hasn't been loaded when the script runs.
                Therefore, document.getElementById("test") returns null, and attempting to set textContent will result in an error.
            </p>
            <h3> ● At the start of the body tag </h3> 
            <p>
                 In this scenario, the script executes immediately as the browser parses the "body" section. 
                 However, since the "h1" element is defined after the "script" tag, 
                 it hasn't been loaded into the DOM when the script runs. Consequently, document.getElementById("test")
                  returns null, and attempting to set textContent will result in an error.
            </p>
            <h3>● At the end of the body tag </h3>
            <p>
                Here, the browser has already parsed and loaded all the elements within the "body", including the "h1"
                 element, by the time it encounters the "script" tag.
                  Therefore, document.getElementById("test") successfully retrieves the "h1" element,
                   and its textContent is updated to "Goodbye World!" as intended.
            </p>
        </p>
    </body>
